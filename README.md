# Scriptforge (Luaforge)

This mod aimed to implement a Lua interface for the Minecraft Forge API. The API was never fully implemented, and the last known version of Minecraft that this mod worked with was 1.6 (I think).

# Warning

This mod is no longer maintained. All code was written in 2013 and 2012, much of it by [samrg472](https://github.com/samrg472) (although [Cloudhunter](https://github.com/Cloudhunter) also contributed). I am only keeping this repository for historical reference and slight nostalgia.

If you would like to maintain the mod, please contact me [here](mailto:aldahick@iupui.edu).
